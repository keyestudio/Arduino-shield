**Introduction:**
\
Keyestudio Proto Shield is particularly designed for the Arduino UNO R3. It
makes it easy for you to design custom circuits and solder electronics directly
on it.

For convenient use, there is a large prototyping space of both connected and
unconnected spaced through-holes on the shield.

There is also a soldering position reserved for SMD chip on the protoshield. You
can easily solder SMD ICs on the prototyping area to test them with your Arduino
board.

It also extends out a row of power and ground spaced through-holes, giving
enough port resources.

You can even stick a mini 170-holes breadboard (included) on the prototyping
area. You can weld elements on the shield directly or connect circuits with the
mini breadboard.

**Product Parameters:**

-   Can be plugged into the Arduino controller.

-   Extend 5V, 3V and Arduino Vin voltage.

-   Comes with a Reset button.

-   Extend out all control pins and power pins of the Arduino.

-   Able to build the prototyping circuits matched with Arduino.

-   Access to SOIC SMD pin, supporting the soldering of SOIC chips up to 14pin.

-   Includes a 170-hole breadboard.

**Mini Breadboard:**

This is a solderless mini breadboard. It has 10 columns, and 17 rows - a total
of 170 tie in points. This mini breadboard has a self-adhesive on the back.

You can stick it on the prototyping area of protoshield for solderless
operation.

**Example Use:**

You can first stick the 170-tie points breadboard on the prototyping area of
Proto Shield. Stack the shield onto UNO R3 board. Use an LED, a resistor and
several breadboard jumper wires to build the circuit experiments.
