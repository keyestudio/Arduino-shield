# **Keyestudio 4-channel Relay Shield**

**![](media/1319d09cd310205c51a82b42792d5113.jpeg)**

**Introduction**

The keyestudio relay shield has integrated a 4-channel 5V relay module, which is
fully compatible with [UNO R3 control
board](http://wiki.keyestudio.com/index.php/Ks0001_keyestudio_UNO_R3_BOARD).

The 4-channel relay on the shield is active at HIGH level. Separately connect
the 4-channel relay to the digital port 4, 5, 6, 7 on the UNO R3 board, then
through controlling output HIGH or LOW to control the relay on and off.

**Features:**

-   The relay shield is 5V active HIGH

-   Contact capacity: AC120V / 3A ; DC24V/3A

-   Onboard LED indicator for relay output status

-   Indicator: 4 LEDs are red when the relay is driven high, the corresponding
    indicator will light up.

-   Standard interface can be directly connected with microcontrollers.

-   Fully compatible with UNO R3 board

-   Be able to control various appliances and other equipment with large
    current.

-   3 M3 screw positioning holes for easy installation

-   Power Interface: 5V DC power interface

-   Channel: 4 channel

-   PCB Color: Black

**Details:**

-   Size: 69mm\*54mm\*26mm

-   Weight: 39.4g

**Relay Terminals:**

Terminal high-power, high-current high voltage can be connected to the device.

When D4 is High, RELAY 4 turns on, LED4 lights up, COM4 and NO4 connected, COM4
and NC4 disconnected.

If D4 is LOW, RELAY 4 turns off, LED4 not light, COM4 and NO4 disconnected, COM4
and NC4 connected.

When D5 is High, RELAY 3 turns on, LED3 lights up, COM3 and NO3 connected, COM3
and NC3 disconnected.

If D5 is LOW, RELAY 3 turns off, LED3 not light, COM3 and NO3 disconnected, COM3
and NC3 connected.

When D6 is High, RELAY 2 turns on, LED2 lights up, COM2 and NO2 connected, COM2
and NC2 disconnected.

If D6 is LOW, RELAY 2 turns off, LED2 not light, COM2 and NO2 disconnected, COM2
and NC2 connected.

When D7 is High, RELAY 1 turns on, LED1 lights up, COM1 and NO1 connected, COM1
and NC1 disconnected.

If D7 is LOW, RELAY 1 turns off, LED1 not light, COM1 and NO1 disconnected, COM1
and NC1 connected.

**Hookup Guide**

Simply stack the shield on the UNO board.

int BASE = 4 ; //The first relay is connected to the I / O port

int NUM = 4; //Total number of relays

void setup()

{

for (int i = BASE; i \< BASE + NUM; i ++)

{

pinMode(i, OUTPUT); //Set the number I/O port to outputs

}

}

void loop()

{

for (int i = BASE; i \< BASE + NUM; i ++)

{

digitalWrite(i, LOW); //Set the number I/O port outputs to "low", that is,
gradually turn off the relay.

delay(200); //delay 0.2S

}

for (int i = BASE; i \< BASE + NUM; i ++)

{

digitalWrite(i, HIGH); //Set the number I/O port outputs to "high", that is,
gradually turn on relay.

delay(200); //delay 0.2S

}

}

**Test Result**

Done uploading the above code, you should see the 4-channel relay is first
connected, and then disconnected one after another, repeatedly.
