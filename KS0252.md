**Introduction:**

Sometimes you might feel very troublesome when connect the breadboard or sensor
shield to Arduino board with a bunch of jumper wires.

Now we have launched this Proto Screw Shield, very reliable and easy for you to
connect the wire.

The shield also comes with a double-sided prototyping area so that you can
solder some electronic elements to design your various prototype circuits.

It also comes with a reset button and a D13 indicator. This shield is an
integration of Arduino Screw Shield and Proto Shield.

**Features:**

-   Providing the terminal block IO, convenient for connection.

-   High-quality terminal block, reliable, convenient and durable.

-   Compatible with ProtoShield, the middle part can be used as proto shield.

-   Comes with double-sided PCB through-hole prototyping area, welding some
    elements as you like.

-   You can place a tiny breadboard on the through-hole pad to make extension
    experiments.

-   Comes with a reset button

-   Comes with D13 indicator
