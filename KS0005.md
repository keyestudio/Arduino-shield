# **KS0005 Keyestudio MEGA ProtoShield V3 with Breadboard**

**![](KS0005/media/cc9e45525f2fe6bc4448a4af8fe9a99a.jpeg)**

**Introduction:**

Keyestudio ProtoShield is particularly designed for the MEGA 2560. It makes

it easy for you to design custom circuits and solder electronics directly on it.

For convenient use, there is a large prototyping space of both connected and
unconnected spaced through-holes on the shield.

There is also a soldering position reserved for SMD chip on the protoshield. You
can easily solder SMD ICs on the prototyping area to test them with your Arduino

board.

It also extends out a row of power and ground through-holes, giving enough port
resources.

You can even stick a tiny 170-holes breadboard (included) on the prototyping
area. You can weld elements on the shield directly or connect circuits with tiny
breadboard.

**Features:**

-   Can be plugged into the MEGA 2560 control board

-   Extends 5V, 3V and Arduino Vin pins

-   Comes with a Reset button

-   Comes with a power led and a D13 indicator

-   Extends an ICSP interface

-   Extends out all the control pins and power pins of Arduino

-   Able to build the prototyping circuits matched with Arduino

-   Can weld with 28PIN chip

-   Includes a tiny 170-hole breadboard

**Tiny Breadboard:**

This is a solderless tiny breadboard. It has 10 columns, and 17 rows - a total
of 170 tie in points. This tiny breadboard has a self-adhesive on the back.

You can stick it on the prototyping area of protoshield for solderless
operation.

**Example Use:**

![](KS0005/media/f149d1bbe058eb6181ae83a55ddc730c.png)You can first stick the 170-tie
points breadboard on the prototyping area of Proto Shield. Stack the shield onto
UNO R3 board. Use several LEDs, resistors and breadboard jumper wires to build
the circuit experiments.
