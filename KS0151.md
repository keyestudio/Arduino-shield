**Introduction:**

keyestudio CNC shield V2 is used as driving shield for engraving machines, fully
compatible with [UNO
R3](http://wiki.keyestudio.com/index.php/Ks0001_keyestudio_UNO_R3_BOARD).

It has total 3-way pin slots for stepper motor drive modules (Not Included) to
drive 3-channel stepper motors.

Each stepper motor only needs 2 IO ports, so 6 IO ports is enough to manage 3
stepper motors, very easy to use. This shield can make quick work for managing
stepper motors in your project.

To easily debug the operating mode of stepper motor driver board, there are 3
jumper caps under each pin slots. You can set the working mode by plugging or
unplugging the jumper cap.

For example, connect the
[A4988](http://www.keyestudio.com/keyestudio-reprap-stepper-motor-driver.html)
to the shield, unplug three jumpers, it is in full-step mode; if plug all the
jumpers, it is 16-subdivision working mode.

Different kinds of interfaces are brought out on this shield, so you can connect
some external devices as you like.

**Check out these awesome specifications:**

-   UNO R3 control board compatible

-   Supports the software
    [*GrblController361Setup*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JSCtHr7FLF7UMxXeVGpwMbWn3BVZo7jh)

-   Can drive the X/Y/Z-axis stepper motors

-   Control the drive module via jumper cap. (Note: If connect the
    [A4988](http://www.keyestudio.com/keyestudio-reprap-stepper-motor-driver.html),
    unplug three jumpers, as full-step mode; if plug the jumpers, 16-subdivision
    working mode.)

-   Comes with three 4pin headers of 2.54mm pitch for 42 step motor connection.

-   You can directly plug 3 [stepper motor drive
    modules](http://www.keyestudio.com/keyestudio-drv8825-stepper-motor-driver-for-3d-printer.html)
    into this shield, default X_STP (connected to D2); X_DIR (D5); Y_STP (D3);
    Y_DIR(D6); Z_STP (D4); Z_DIR(D7).

-   The enabled port (EN) of all drive modules has been connected to D8.

-   Can supply the power for 3 stepper motor drive modules via the blue terminal
    blocks with DC 12V voltage.

-   Other communication ports, like the serial communication, I2C communication.

**Using Method:**

When using this shield, on the hardware, you need to use it with the control
board ([UNO
R3](http://wiki.keyestudio.com/index.php/Ks0001_keyestudio_UNO_R3_BOARD)), the
drive board (such as
[A4988](http://www.keyestudio.com/keyestudio-reprap-stepper-motor-driver.html)),
the motor (42 stepper motor) and others. And you need to burn the firmware to
the control board. So need to use the software [Arduino
IDE](http://wiki.keyestudio.com/index.php/How_to_Download_Arduino_IDE), and the
special upper computer software, such as [GrblController361Setup
software.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JSCtHr7FLF7UMxXeVGpwMbWn3BVZo7jh)
