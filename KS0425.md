# Overview

keyestudio Nano ch340 is a tiny control board based on Arduino platform, which
is deeply popular.

However, if want to connect several sensor modules to keyestudio Nano ch340, and
connect external power, we need to use breadboard and a bunch of jumper wires,
which is pretty inconvenient.

We specially design this NANO shield, fully compatible with keyestudio Nano
ch340.

The NANO shield has brought out digital and analog pins of keyestudio Nano ch340
into 3PIN headers (GND, 5V, Signal) with pin pitch of 2.54mm.

The NANO shield also leads out frequently-used communication pins, such as
serial port communication and I2C communication. It’s greatly easy to connect
keyestudio Nano ch340 and other sensor modules.

It comes with a power indicator and a reset button as well.

![ks0425-4](media/98bf9c07ef346b5a97d9c99c9833505a.jpeg)For external power, the
NANO shield comes with a PH2.0-2P connector (input DC7-12V); a Power_Switch for
power control.

To supply power for other sensors, the NANO shield comes with a 3-way DC3.3V
power output pin header with pin pitch of 2.54mm.

It comes with 4 fixing holes with a diameter of 3mm, so easy to mount on other
devices.

# Features

# Use Method

We can use keyestudio Nano ch340 as control board, separately connect 3 LED
modules to D4\~D6 3Pin interface. Then upload the test code to make LED flash
one by one, achieving light flow effect.

# Wiring Diagram

# Test Code

int BASE = 4; // I/O pin connected to the first LED

int NUM = 3; //the number of LED

void setup()

{

for (int i = BASE; i \< BASE + NUM; i ++)

{

pinMode(i, OUTPUT); //set the digital I/O pin to output

}

}

void loop()

{

for (int i = BASE; i \< BASE + NUM; i ++)

{

digitalWrite(i, HIGH); //set the digital I/O pin output to "HIGH"，gradually
turn on LED

delay(200); //delay

}

for (int i = BASE; i \< BASE + NUM; i ++)

{

digitalWrite(i, LOW); //set the digital I/O pin output to "LOW"，gradually turn
off LED

delay(200); //delay

}

}

# Test Result

Upload well the code to keyestudio Nano ch340 shield, then press down
Power_Switch, the LED module will flash one by one.
