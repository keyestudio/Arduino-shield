**Introduction:**

You can use UNO R3 microcontroller and add external components to complete a
variety of amazing experiments, such as smart robot DIY.

When DIY your robot, it is necessary to use the motor driver board to drive the
DC motors, however, sometimes need to connect the motor drive board to UNO using
lots of jumper wires, pretty inconvenient.

Now, we have launched this keyestudio motor shield with L298P as core.

Note that the motor’s speed and direction interfaces have been connected. D3 is
for controlling the speed of motor A, and D12 is for controlling the direction
of motor A. D11 is for controlling the speed of motor B, and D13 is for
controlling the direction.

Just simply stack the shield onto UNO board to power the shield and UNO board.
The 3 kinds of power supply are as follows:

-   You can power the board via the black DC jack on the UNO R3 board.

-   Or power the board through the VIN GND female header of 2.54mm pitch on the
    shield.

-   Supply the power through the green terminal blocks on the shield.

The L298P shield also comes with through-hole welding space, so you are able to
weld the electronic elements to design a variety of prototyping circuits.

**Pay close attention to:**

The shield comes with a slide switch. When power via the DC jack on the UNO R3
and female headers on the L298P shield, the slide switch is not available.

But when power via the green terminal blocks on the L298P shield, the slide
switch can be used as power control switch.

**Parameters:**

**How to Test it ?**

**Connect it Up:**

Simply stack the shield onto UNO R3 board, then connect two motors to terminal
block.

**Upload the Code:**

Below is an example code, you can copy and paste it on [Arduino
IDE](http://wiki.keyestudio.com/index.php/Download_Arduino_IDE).

-   [Download Arduino
    IDE](http://wiki.keyestudio.com/index.php/How_to_Download_Arduino_IDE)

-   [Install Arduino

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

int E1 = 3; int M1 = 12;int E2 =11; int M2 = 13; void setup(){ pinMode(M1,
OUTPUT); pinMode(M2, OUTPUT);}void loop(){ digitalWrite(M1,HIGH);
digitalWrite(M2, HIGH); analogWrite(E1, 200); // PWM regulate speed
analogWrite(E2, 200); // PWM regulate speed delay(8000); digitalWrite(M1,LOW);
digitalWrite(M2, LOW); analogWrite(E1, 200); //PWM regulate speed
analogWrite(E2, 200); //PWM regulate speed delay(8000);}

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Test Result:**

Upload well the code, turn the switch ON, you should see the two motors firstly
turn forward for 8 seconds, then reverse for 8 seconds, alternately and
circularly.

Turn the switch OFF, the voltage is disconnected, the motor will keep still.
