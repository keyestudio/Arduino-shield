**Description**

When make a DIY smart car, the motor driver board is required. We particularly
design this driver board to make it compatible with UNO R3 control board.

It is powerful and has following features:

1.  Enjoying a stackable design, it only need to stack on UNO R3 control board,
    which save space and facilitate connections.

2.  The two TB6612FNG chips on driver board can drive motor to rotate and 4 DC
    motors as well, which is convenient.

3.  It comes with a PCA9685 chip(IIC address:0x47) which can output 16 channel
    PWM outputs, 8 of which is meant for controlling rotation speed and
    direction of 4 motors, and the other 8 PWM outputs are led to by 3pin head
    of 2.54mm pitch and can control other devices like servo motor.

4.  Driver board expands D11/D10/D9/D5/D4/D3/D2/A3 pins of UNO R3 control board
    into 3pin head of 2.54mm pitch, leads to I2C communication port by 4pin head
    and serial communication port by 4pin female header, which facilitate
    linking with Bluetooth module.

5\. Driver board comes with 5 PH2.0mm-2P anti-reverse interfaces for external
power and 4 motors; 3 PH2.0mm-3P, 1 PH2.0mm-4P and 1 PH2.0mm-5P interfaces for
connecting to sensors/ modules.

1.  Power supply IC is LM2596S-5.0, with massive loading capacity, maximum
    current can reach 3A and drive multiple servos.

2.  The built-in DIP switch on driver board enhances to control external supply.

3.  8 jumper caps of driver board decide the rotation direction of motor. For
    instance, when 2 jumper caps of MA motor is connected in vertical way
    instead of horizontal way, its rotation direction is the opposite.

4.  Driver board can drive DC motor up to 12v. The voltage of drive motor is set
    by external power supply and test code. For example, when the external
    supply is DC 12V, set the PWM to maximum value and the corresponding driving
    voltage is 12 V.

**Parameters:**

Working voltage: DC 8-12V  
Drive current: up to 3A   
Maximum power: 10W  
Working temperature: -20 ℃ ～ ＋ 60 ℃  
White interface type: PH2.0 (-2P -3P -4P -5P)  
Pin header / female spacing: 2.54mm  
Size: 68.7mm \* 55mm  
Environmental protection attributes: ROHS

**Note: PWM8-PWM15 is only connected to 2 servos on above diagram.**

**In the code , PWM8-PWM15 can control 8 servos for test.**

| Adjust rotation direction | Adjust rotation speed | Status                           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| pwm.setPWM(0,0,4095)      | pwm.setPWM(1,0,1024)  | MB motor turns clockwise         |
| pwm.setPWM(0,0,0)         | pwm.setPWM(1,0,2048)  | MB motor turns counterclockwise  |
| pwm.setPWM(2,0,4095)      | pwm.setPWM(3,0,1024)  | MB1 motor turns clockwise        |
| pwm.setPWM(2,0,0)         | pwm.setPWM(3,0,2048)  | MB1 motor turns counterclockwise |
| pwm.setPWM(4,0,4095)      | pwm.setPWM(5,0,1024)  | MA1 motor turns clockwise        |
| pwm.setPWM(4,0,0)         | pwm.setPWM(5,0,2048)  | MA1 motor turns counterclockwise |
| pwm.setPWM(6,0,4095)      | pwm.setPWM(7,0,1024)  | MA motor turns clockwise         |
| pwm.setPWM(6,0,0)         | pwm.setPWM(7,0,2048)  | MA motor turns counterclockwise  |

**Test Code**

**Note: 1. monitor data setting when adjusting speed. For instance, when
external supply is DC 8V, if the maximum drive voltage of drive motor is 5V, set
the maximum value of PWM to 4096\*5/8=2560. The value can’t exceed 2560.
Otherwise, external motor will damage.**

1.  **Before uploading test code, need to place library file in the directory of
    compiler installation, otherwise fail to compile,such as: C:\\Program
    Files\\Arduino\\libraries**

**Test Result**

Upload test code on UNO R3 control board, wire according to connection diagram
and power it on. When DIP switch of driver board is dialed to BAT end, the
external 4 motors rotate clockwise for 5s, counterclockwise for 5s and
stop；moreover, 8 external servos rotate to 0° then 180°, and repeat the
previous action alternately.
